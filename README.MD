# Enemy control

This is an algorithm project in which we use a MonteCarlo algorithm in order to assign the path the enemies will take to reach the player.

**_You can assign a value of 1 to the Radio component in Enemy if wish to observe how the OverlapSphere grows as it doesn't find any Gameobject near it. Or you can simply add a big number in order to observe MonteCarlo effect_**
